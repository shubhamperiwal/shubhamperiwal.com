                    Given that I have had no formal training in Finance
                    throughout my education, taking on CFA Level 1 will help me
                    gain the fundamentals of a <b>completely new vertical.</b>
                    <br />
                    I can gradually apply what I'm learning during my work in
                    GIC to serve them even better. <br />
                    Studying for CFA Level 1 has also helped me gain a better
                    understanding of my personal finances. <br />

                    The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area <br/><br/>
                    As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, 
                    people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive. <br/><br/>
